Minor
-----
- FILES command line option '-e' does not appear to actually be supported from command line
- CNTRL help definition of 'ntwr' is incorrect
- EWALD should this specify how to set ewald type?
- PARAM make argument description notation consistent (e.g. <string>)
- "ConlumnsForAtoms"
- FITQ remove parm. file
- IPOLQ warn that NTP is not supported

Possible Features
-----------------

- Support NetCDF restarts?

Fixed
-----

- When running on single core, PAL1 line in orca leads to crash (change to orca)
- Appears to fail whenever -O is not specified
- FITQ  help should say 'TIP4P-Ew oxygen', not 'TIP4P oxygen'
