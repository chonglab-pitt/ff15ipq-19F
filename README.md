DT Yang, AM Gronenborn, LT Chong. “Integrating Fluorinated Amino Acids into the Framework of the AMBER ff15ipq Force Field.” bioRxiv 2022, 475229; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.06.475229

* force field parameters for fluorinated amino acids commonly used with <sup>19</sup>F NMR experiments
   * TODO: add figure with new residue classes and atom types
* added key files with .py, .sh, .in, .pdb, and .slurm extensions
    * using these files, all results should be reproducible
* not all original files were included due to size limitations
    * raw data is available upon request: please email dty7@pitt.edu
* see analysis for Python scripts used for analysis and figure generation 
* see final_parameters for the AMBER compatible frcmod (bonded parameters) and leap (ipq charges) files for use with the ff15ipq protein force field
   * TODO: add atom types and expanded instructions
